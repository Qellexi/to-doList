# Tkinter To-Do List (CLI + GUI)

A minimal yet functional task-manager written in **Python 3**.  
It supports both a **console interface** and a **Tkinter GUI**, lets you add, edit, delete tasks, mark them as done, and stores everything in a local `tasks.json` file.

## Features
- **Cross-platform GUI** with Tkinter  
- **CLI commands** for quick terminal use  
- **JSON persistence** – tasks survive app restarts  
- **Inline editing**: click “Edit”, change text or deadline, hit “Save”  
- **Task status toggle** with a checkbox  
- Basic input validation + helpful pop-ups
